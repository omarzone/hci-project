## Brief<a name="id1"></a>
After making our first draft, we got a more complex approach to where we want our project to go. It is clear to us that the English language is a factor that affects the confidence of students when they need to express themselves in English.

Our breakthrough is our first draft of "Persona" that will help to identify the possible users that will be involved in the problem.

In addition, among the artifacts we include the list of possible functions that our product could have.

By this week we expect to refine our "Persona" proposal, and start designing the prototype of our possible product.
