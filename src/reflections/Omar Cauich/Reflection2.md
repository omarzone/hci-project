# HCI&UX
HCI is the part that focuses on making an app or program easy to use, while UX is about how people feel when using it. They are two different things, but both are important.

One difference between HCI and UX is that HCI focuses on designing the interaction between the user and the system, while UX focuses on how people feel when using the system. For example, in a shopping app, HCI would be responsible for designing the flow of the checkout process, while UX would be responsible for ensuring that the overall experience is pleasant and engaging. A HCI feature that could be added to improve the user's interaction might be a voice-activated search function. This allows the user to easily navigate through the app without having to manually type in their search queries, ultimately leading to a more seamless and efficient experience.

Regarding our app to improve confidence when speaking English, a UX feature we could add is a feedback and pronunciation assessment tool. This would allow users to record their voice and receive instant feedback on their pronunciation and intonation. They could also practice in real-time with a voice recognition tool and receive immediate feedback. With this feature, the app would help users improve their confidence and skills in English pronunciation.
