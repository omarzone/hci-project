Key points and justification

Lack of confidence in speaking English is a common problem among young students.
    Justification: Lack of confidence can be a barrier to developing proficiency in a foreign language, making it important to address this issue to help students improve their ability.

The use of small group discussions and final projects that require public presentations are effective strategies to help students overcome lack of confidence.
    Justification: These strategies allow students to practice and develop their English speaking ability in a safe and comfortable environment, which helps them build confidence as they improve.

Less extroverted students in their native language tend to have more difficulty trusting their English speaking ability.
    Justification: Introversion can be a factor in lack of confidence in speaking a second language, as introverted students may be less likely to speak publicly and may be afraid of making mistakes.

Motivation to practice English can be increased through information about university exchange programs.
    Justification: The prospect of traveling and experiencing different cultures can be a motivating incentive for students, encouraging them to improve their English speaking ability in order to take advantage of these opportunities.
