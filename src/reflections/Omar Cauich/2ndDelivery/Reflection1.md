# UI vs UX
UI is the visible and tangible part of a product that users can see and touch, such as a web page design, a purchase button or an application icon. UX, on the other hand, is the experience the user has when interacting with the product, and this includes the UI, but also involves aspects such as navigation, usability and overall user satisfaction.
In my case, my team is working with an Alexa Skill to help students improve their confidence in speaking English. For our project the UI is not very important as the user is not looking at the app, but interacting with it through voice. However, the UX plays a very important role because it is how the user interacts with the skill. For example, if you are designing an Alexa skill that works as a help "bot" to converse in English, it is important to define the ease with which the user can activate and use the skill, training the model with short or intuitive words that allow the user to start a conversation with the skill in the most comfortable way possible.

Another example of UX would be the ability of the skill to understand and respond appropriately to the thread of the user's conversation, it is important that our "bot" maintains consistency with the answers depending on the topic of conversation with the user.
