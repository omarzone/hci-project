# Presentation of each of the stages and transition between prototypes
This report aims to provide an overview of the implementation stages of a project, focusing on the processes, products and results obtained at each stage. In addition, the transition between stages and the evolution of the developed prototypes will be described.

## Identification of the target person:
In this initial stage, a detailed analysis was carried out to identify the target person or end user of the project. This will be crucial, since the success of the implementation depends to a large extent on the needs and characteristics of the person to whom it is addressed. Specific demographics, preferences, habits and requirements were collected to develop suitable solutions.

## Prototyping:
After identifying the target person, two prototypes were generated. The first prototype was a functional ChatGPT, which consisted of implementing a chat interface based on artificial intelligence to interact with the user. This prototype made it possible to evaluate the responsiveness of the model and its ability to understand and generate appropriate responses.

The second prototype was a fully text-based simulator, implemented using Alexa skills. The main goal of this prototype was to provide a safe and anxiety-free platform for users to practice their English expression. Simulated conversation scenarios and situations are designed so that users can interact and improve their language skills.

## Results and usability tests:
During this stage, extensive usability tests were carried out on both prototypes. Quantitative and qualitative data was collected to assess the performance of the prototypes and the user experience. Metrics such as response rate, accuracy of responses, interface ease of use, and user satisfaction were analyzed.
The results obtained from usability tests provide valuable information to improve and refine the prototypes. Areas for improvement were identified and adjustments were made based on user feedback and suggestions.

## Transition between stages:
The transition between the stages was based on the continuous analysis of the results obtained. As data was collected and prototypes were evaluated, adjustments and improvements were made at each stage. The findings and lessons learned in one stage were used to inform and guide the development of the next stage.

## Transition between prototypes:
The transition between the two prototypes was an iterative process. As the functional ChatGPT prototype was developed, user feedback was obtained and improvements were made to the text-based simulator. This allowed for constant feedback and continuous improvement on both prototypes.

## Conclusions:
The successful implementation of each stage of the project, from identifying the target person to usability testing and transitioning between prototypes, was critical to the success of the project.
