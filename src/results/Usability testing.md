# Materials used for testing

Conversations between users and Alexa were simulated with the help of ChatGPT, focusing on specific topics such as hobbies, English practice and movie recommendations, all with the aim of putting users' speaking skills into practice. Participants interacted with the assistant in different scenarios, providing comments and observations about their experience. A design guide was also developed to facilitate the development of the prototype and make development more efficient.

# Results

## Test 1:
During the first observational test, alexa's performance was evaluated in terms of maintaining the thread of the conversation and providing answers consistent with the user's instructions. Overall, alexa proved to be able to maintain the flow of the conversation and respond appropriately to the questions posed. In addition, alexa was observed to follow the instruction to ask a question in its response, which helps to keep the conversation active and ongoing.

However, a deficiency was identified in meeting the word limit assigned in the main prompt. alexa exceeded the limit by up to 15 words, which can be problematic in situations where strict adherence to text length is required. This can result in overly lengthy responses and make reading and comprehension difficult.

## Test 2:
In the second test, Alexa's performance in maintaining the thread of the conversation and following the instructions provided continued to be assessed. It was observed that alexa manages to maintain the flow of the conversation consistently, which is positive.

However, two significant problems were detected. First, alexa does not respect the word limit assigned in the main prompt, which may cause longer than expected responses and affect the efficiency and conciseness of the dialogue. Second, alexa repeats the prompt in its first response, which is unnecessary and not in line with expectations.

In addition, it was found that alexa asks two questions in the same answer, which can generate confusion in the user when answering. It is important to consider that a single clear question would facilitate a more fluid and understandable interaction.

## Test 3:
The third test focused on evaluating alexa's tracking of the conversation topic and its ability to ask relevant questions based on the user's answers. In general, alexa showed ability to keep the topic of conversation and ask related questions.

However, it was again observed that alexa asks two questions in the same response, which can lead to confusion and difficulties in providing an appropriate response. In addition, it was identified that alexa completely ignores the word limit set when asked to provide recommendations. This results in lengthy responses that can make it difficult to extract relevant information.

In summary, the observations made in the tests indicate that alexa has skills in maintaining the thread of conversation and following instructions to some extent. However, there are important areas for improvement, such as adhering to word limits, avoiding unnecessary repetition, and limiting questions to one per response. These deficiencies can affect the clarity and efficiency of communication with alexa.
