# Scanning Patterns
Right now I don't think we have any of those patterns present in our prototype, this is mainly due to the type of product we are focusing on.
We who are designing an Alexa skill, the visual interface may not be as important as the user experience itself, since users interact primarily through voice. However, if at some point we decide to make a more comprehensive skill, which presents information on screen-enabled devices,visual scanning patterns should be taken into account when designing any visual elements that accompany the skill, such as welcome screens, confirmation screens, assessment of the level of conversation with the user, etc.
In our current prototype I don't think it is necessary to consider any scanning patterns, but assuming we decide to implement skill compatibility with display devices, non-functional usability requirements for an Alexa skill, such as efficiency and user satisfaction, should be considered.It is also important to consider visual scanning patterns to ensure that the information is easy to find and that the user experience is satisfactory.
