# Usability test
### Emotional feedback test: 
During a test session, participants would be asked to provide feedback on how they felt during the conversation with the artificial intelligence, by asking questions to determine if they felt comfortable, relaxed, or if they experienced anxiety or frustration at any point. Participants may also be asked to rate their level of comfort on a scale of 1 to 10 after the conversation, so that this feedback can be used to identify problem areas in the system and provide valuable information for making improvements.

### Observation test: 
A test session will be conducted in which an observer can evaluate the facial expressions and body language of the participants during the conversation with the artificial intelligence, this observer should be attentive to signs of anxiety or frustration, such as uncomfortable movements, tense gestures, or negative facial expressions. The observer can also record response times and the duration of pauses during the conversation to determine if there are moments when the participant seems uncomfortable or unsure, obtaining useful information about how participants interact with the system and whether there is any element that causes anxiety or frustration.
