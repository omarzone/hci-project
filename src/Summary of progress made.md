# First delivery
### Our initial idea for the project was to find a way to help students who wished to learn English have the opportunity to do so. However, after several analyses, research, and feedback, we ended up focusing our project on university students who have the necessary knowledge to speak English but are afraid or anxious, which hinders them from doing so. For the first deliverable, we collected a series of data through surveys and interviews with both professionals and university students. These data validated that the perspective we were heading towards was correct, allowing us to proceed with designing user personas and expected user profiles, along with some possible strategies to combat this problem.

# Second delivery
### After analyzing this information and with the help of feedback from the first deliverable, we were able to define what we thought would be the perfect proposal to address this issue. We designed an Alexa skill that enables seamless communication between a university student and the bot using the Chat GPT API. This way, the user could interact with the AI as if it were a real person, receiving mutual feedback for continuous improvement of both the user and the skill. In the second deliverable, we detailed the project requirements, which were continuously modified until we achieved the desired ones.

# Third delivery
### Finally, in this final deliverable, we decided to put the project into practice. However, we encountered various problems. First, due to the limited tokens with the Chat GPT API, it was challenging to implement long responses in the bot that maintained the context of the conversation. Second, despite attempting to limit the word count of the AI's responses to solve the first problem, the bot simply ignored this restriction, generating long responses that fell into the same issue. Therefore, after realizing that despite being a functional implementation, it was too complicated to fix these errors, we decided to simulate the complete conversation while maintaining the desire and future thinking of achieving a perfect implementation of this project.
