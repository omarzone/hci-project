# UI Design Patterns
Assuming that our Alexa skill is compatible with devices with integrated display, it could include two buttons on the main interface, one to start a new conversation and one to show evaluation of the conversation. Both buttons are important for the functionality of the skill, but it is necessary for users to clearly know which is the primary and most important action on the screen.
To apply the Clear primary actions pattern, we could make the "Start New Conversation" button an eye-catching color, such as green, while the "Show Conversation Evaluation" button could be a less eye-catching color, such as gray. In this way, the green button would stand out and be easily recognizable as the main action. We could also hide the button to show the conversation evaluation, if a conversation has not yet been started.
In addition, to further reinforce the clarity of the main action, you could place the "Start New Conversation" button somewhere that stands out on the screen, such as at the top or in the center. The "Show Conversation Evaluation" button could be placed in a less conspicuous location, such as in the lower right corner of the screen. This way, users could easily recognize the main action quickly and effectively.
