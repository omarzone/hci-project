## Brief<a name="id1"></a>

After Refining our User Profiles and Personas, we need to draft our defined Requirements.
Although most of them will be modified or removed at some point, it's important for us to be able have this artifact so that we can start identifying the needs of our product in relation to its market counterparts and its unique features.
By the end of this week we expect to finish a formal first definition of the requirements and be able to define the unique features of our product.
