# Elicitation Methods


We used the online survey technique through Google Forms and it was carried out by distributing the link through groups of math faculty students.

Overall, I consider the implementation to be adequate, as a potentially relevant user group for the problem was chosen and the link was shared in a friendly and respectful manner to request their collaboration.

The result of the technique was an artifact in the form of a report with the data collected in the survey, which allowed the team to gain a general overview of the problem and discover an important factor that influences students when speaking in public: the fear of making mistakes or mispronouncing words.

However, as I mentioned earlier, we could have improved the technique and resulting artifact. One possible improvement would be to add open-ended questions to gain a deeper understanding of the problem and user needs. In addition, the inclusion of demographic questions such as age and education level could be considered to obtain a more accurate understanding of user profiles. Finally, the resulting report could be generated in a more visual and attractive manner to make the data easier to understand and use.
