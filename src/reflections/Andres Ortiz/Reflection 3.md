# Elicitation Methods

I think elicitation techniques are really important for helping people overcome anxiety and fear when it comes to speaking English, and as a part of a team that's working on a project to do just that, we decided to use online surveys as our elicitation technique.

We put a lot of thought into the questions we asked on the survey and made sure they were easy to understand and answer. We used a reliable survey tool to collect the data, and we ended up with a lot of responses that we could analyze to identify patterns in people's experiences.

However, looking back on it, I see that we could have done a better job of including more open-ended questions. We did use some of these types of questions, but not as many as we could have. I think this would have allowed us to get more detailed information from people about their experiences with anxiety and fear.

Another important point is that it's worth considering that not everyone has access to technology or is comfortable sharing their personal information online. In the future, we might use a combination of online surveys and other elicitation techniques, like in-depth interviews or focus groups, to get a more diverse range of perspectives. Overall, I think our team did a good job with the online surveys, but there's always room for improvement.
