# Using Personas
In our case, we use the information obtained from the definition of our "Persona" to adapt the language and presentation of our Alexa skill. As our users are university students with a certain level of English, we use clear and simple language, avoiding technical terms and complex words. We also ensure that instructions and questions are easy to understand and follow to avoid confusion or misunderstandings.
In addition, when designing our first prototype, we used GPT technology to generate test conversations that could be had with students in our age range and with the level of English we are targeting to ensure that the prototype is intuitive and easy to use for our target users. For example, we used simple keywords to trigger the main commands of the skill, such as starting a new conversation or viewing the results of the assessment.
Overall, the information we obtained from the definition of our "persona" was very helpful in designing a user experience tailored to the needs and characteristics of our target audience. We could probably now include new questions that could be useful to complete the persona definition, but due to the stage of the project it is no longer feasible to do so.
