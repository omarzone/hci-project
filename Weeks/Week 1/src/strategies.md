Strategies

1.- Frequent practice and group speaking opportunities: Encouraging students to participate in small group discussions and final projects that require public presentations can help develop their confidence in speaking English.
2.- Foster participation: Encouraging students to actively participate in class and group discussions can help them develop their English speaking ability and increase their confidence.
3.- Emphasize improvement over error: Instead of focusing on the mistakes students make when speaking English, emphasize their progress and their ability to improve.
4.- Provide a safe and non-judgmental environment: By creating a safe and non-judgmental learning environment, students feel more comfortable speaking English and are more willing to actively participate in class.
5.- Share information about exchange programs: By discussing various university exchange programs with students, you can motivate them to practice their English and increase their confidence in speaking publicly.
6.- Offer constructive feedback: By providing constructive and encouraging feedback, students are more motivated to improve their English speaking ability and increase their confidence.
