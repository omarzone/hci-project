# Analysis of the data collected in the survey addressed to university students.

## What do we collect?

Many university students have difficulty speaking English with others. This difficulty is often a consequence of a general lack of confidence, although data indicate that 70.6% of students have problems expressing themselves in English with others.
Students who have this difficulty rarely put their English language skills into practice, because most of them feel insecure and nervous. This is often due to fear of not being understood, fear of making grammatical errors, and lack of vocabulary.
Although many of these students try to improve their skills, they continue to have problems expressing themselves in English. On the other hand, more than 50% say that practicing in a group setting is an effective way to reinforce their confidence, compared to individual practice.
To conclude, students who present this problem are limited when participating in discussions or activities in university classes. Lack of confidence prevents them from expressing their ideas correctly, which leads them to stay away from the activity.

## Why do we collect such information?

Gathering this information is critical to developing concrete strategies to help students overcome this difficulty. It is important to know the underlying causes of the problem and the barriers that prevent students from improving their English language skills. Only then can effective approaches and specific solutions be implemented to help students overcome this difficulty.
Information gathered about the difficulty many college students have in speaking English is essential to developing concrete strategies and effective approaches to address this issue.
