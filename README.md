# 🤓 Problem Statement
The issue to be addressed focuses on the lack of confidence that many students experience when speaking in English. This lack of confidence can be due to a variety of factors, such as fear of making mistakes, embarrassment about mispronouncing words, or lack of practice in oral communication in English. This problem can have a negative impact on students' language skill development, affecting their ability to communicate effectively in the language.



# 🎯 Objetive
The goal is to explore solutions that help students overcome this barrier and improve their confidence in speaking English. This could involve developing training programs that include conversation practice, pronunciation techniques, and effective feedback. Mentoring and tutoring initiatives could also be considered, in which students with advanced language skills can guide and motivate other students to improve their language skills.


# 🙌 Motivation
By addressing this issue, it is hoped that students will be able to improve their language skills, develop greater self-confidence and ultimately be more successful in their academic and professional futures.
